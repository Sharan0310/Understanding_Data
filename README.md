PART A:
In today's dynamic e-commerce landscape, personalized product recommendations play a pivotal role in enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales. Lu's Communications, a prominent UK-based online electronics retailer, recognizes the importance of recommending complementary products to their customers based on their preferences and purchase history. This project aims to delve into the realm of recommender systems, utilizing a dataset provided by Lu's Communications to uncover product similarities and enhance their recommendation engine. Through a comprehensive analysis of the provided data, we will address key questions related to user behavior, product ratings, and similarity metrics.

PART B:
This project embarks on the task of developing a robust churn prediction model that will enable Lu's Communications to proactively identify customers at risk of churning. The objective is to deploy specialized programs and incentives to mitigate the likelihood of customer attrition. However, it is imperative to approach this endeavor with precision, as inaccurate churn predictions could result in a significant financial outlay to incentivize customers who might have remained with the company regardless.
